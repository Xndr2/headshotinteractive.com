                        We know it&apos;s been a bit quiet around here, and you&apos;re probably wondering what&apos;s going on with the game. Just wanted to give you a quick update: we are still hard at work in the background!
                        <br /><br />
                        Right now, most of what we have are placeholder systems, models, and assets, so there hasn&apos;t been a lot to show off yet. Once we get the real models, sounds, animations, and graphics in place, you&apos;ll be seeing a lot more from us.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our goal is to share something really cool by the end of the year, but we&apos;re not 100% sure we&apos;ll make that. Life happens, and since we work on this in our spare time, things can pop up that we don&apos;t expect.
                        <br /><br />
                        Thanks for your patience, and stay tuned! We&apos;re excited to share more when it&apos;s ready!
                        <br /><br />
                        Much love,
                        <br />
